Importing Dataset:
Importing the dataset is a crucial first step. Kaggle is a great platform for accessing diverse datasets. Did you use any specific dataset related to image recognition (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet, etc.)?
Preprocessing:
Preprocessing ensures that your data is clean and ready for training.
Common preprocessing steps include resizing images, normalizing pixel values, handling missing data, and augmenting the dataset.
Training Image Preprocessing:
This step involves preparing the images for training.
Techniques like data augmentation (flipping, rotation, zooming) can improve model generalization.
Building the Model:
You mentioned building a model. Which deep learning architecture did you use? (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet, etc.)
The architecture choice significantly impacts performance.
Convolutional Layers:
Convolutional layers are essential for capturing spatial patterns in images.
Did you customize the number of layers, filter sizes, and activation functions?
Saving the Model in JSON Format:
Saving the model allows you to reuse it without retraining.
JSON format is commonly used for model serialization.
Calculating Accuracy:
Evaluating model accuracy is crucial. How did you split your dataset into training and validation sets?
Did you use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score?
Visualizing Model Performance:
Visualizing accuracy curves, loss curves, and confusion matrices helps understand model behavior.
Matplotlib or Seaborn are handy for creating visualizations.
Predicting on a Single Image:
Exciting! Predicting on a single image demonstrates how well your model generalizes.
