1.Importing Dataset:
Importing the dataset is a crucial first step. Kaggle is a great platform for accessing diverse datasets. Did you use any specific dataset related to image recognition.
<br>
2.Preprocessing:
Preprocessing ensures that your data is clean and ready for training.
Common preprocessing steps include resizing images, normalizing pixel values, handling missing data, and augmenting the dataset.
<br>
3.Training Image Preprocessing:
This step involves preparing the images for training.
Techniques like data augmentation (flipping, rotation, zooming) can improve model generalization.
<br>
4.Building the Model:
<br>
5.Convolutional Layers:
Convolutional layers are essential for capturing spatial patterns in images.
<br>
6.Saving the Model in JSON Format:
Saving the model allows you to reuse it without retraining.
JSON format is commonly used for model serialization.
<br>
7.Calculating Accuracy:
Evaluating model accuracy is crucial. 
<br>
8.Visualizing Model Performance:
Visualizing accuracy curves, loss curves, and confusion matrices helps understand model behavior.
Matplotlib or Seaborn are handy for creating visualizations.
<br>
<br>
9.Predicting on a Single Image:
Exciting! Predicting on a single image demonstrates how well your model generalizes.
